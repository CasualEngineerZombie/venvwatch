VenvWatch is a lightweight Python package that continuously monitors your virtual environment and automatically updates your `requirements.txt` file whenever you install or uninstall a package. No more manually managing dependenciesâ€”VenvWatch does it for you in real-time!


## Features

- **Automatic Sync**: Detects changes in your virtual environment and updates `requirements.txt` instantly.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Runs in the background, listening for any modifications to your installed packages.
- **Simple CLI**: Easy-to-use command-line interface to start and manage the watcher.
- **Configurable Options**: Customize how VenvWatch handles changes, such as removing unused dependencies.

## Installation

Install VenvWatch using pip:

```bash
pip install venvwatch
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

To start monitoring your virtual environment, navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
venvwatch watch
```

VenvWatch will monitor your virtual environment for any changes and update the `requirements.txt` file accordingly.

### Configuration Options

VenvWatch can be customized with a variety of command-line options:

- **`--venv`**: Specify the path to your virtual environment.
  ```bash
  venvwatch watch --venv /path/to/your/venv
  ```

- **`--interval`**: Set the interval (in seconds) for how often VenvWatch checks for changes.
  ```bash
  venvwatch watch --interval 5
  ```

- **`--no-remove`**: Disable automatic removal of dependencies that are no longer in the environment.
  ```bash
  venvwatch watch --no-remove
  ```

### Example

Start watching your virtual environment and update `requirements.txt` in real-time:

```bash
venvwatch watch --venv ./venv --interval 5
```

VenvWatch will run in the background, keeping your `requirements.txt` file perfectly synced with your installed packages.
